# Ralf's Workplace 
The goal of this project is to automate my set up when I get on a new linux machine.

I install multiple tools like: 
- VS Code
- Google Chrome
- i3
- polybar
- ...

I automatically copy and set up my configs to make the transition as seemless as possible. 

# Set up
```
git clone git@github.com:ralf-boltshauser/workplace.git
cd workplace
bash setup.sh
```
